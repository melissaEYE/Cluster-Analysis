# Cluster Analysis

Cluster analysis on eye tracking data with age demographics from RightEye.

The dataset used for the project was "Three_MH_excel_cleaning.csv". https://github.com/melissaEYE/Cluster-Analysis/blob/main/Three_MH_excel_cleaning.csv 

The objective of the analysis was to explore the variables that group together (cluster) to find similarities and relationships within the dataset. More specifically, using K-Means cluster analysis, an unsupervised learning method, to sort items into groups by similarity using eye tracking data and age. 

The objective was to compare how the method clustered the data with age.  Understanding how eye movements change over the lifespan is critical in determining thresholds of normality for baseline comparisons of peoples with suspected injury, clinical condition and for elite levels of performance (Murray, Hunfalvay, & Bolte, 2017; Lange, Hunfalvay, Murray, Roberts, & Bolte, 2018).

This project involves using R to examine a dataset. My analysis involves creating K-means cluster analysis to determine if grouping exists based on age. 

The full report can be found in the file "Clustering Assignment.pdf". This report shows a complete breakdown of my analysis, including problem identification, motivation, data exploration, data preparation, data partition, modeling, model results, model tuning, and proposed solutions. Tables and visualizations are also included.

The R script is included in the file "MHunfalvay_Assignment5.R". Instructions on how to use the program are included as comments in the R file. After opening the file, please read the instructions carefully before executing the code to ensure that the program functions correctly.
